;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a front end to Systemd.
;;
;; Use `M-x systemctl-list-units RET' to see a list of all known
;; Systemd units and their status on localhost.  With a prefix
;; argument (`C-u M-x systemctl-list-units RET') you will be prompted
;; for a remote host to connect to.
;;
;; In systemctl-list-units-mode, `RET' will visit all relevant
;; configuration fragments for the unit at point (the equivalent of
;; "systemctl cat some.service").  With a `C-u' prefix argument, it
;; will prompt for a new override.conf file to create (somewhat
;; equivalent to "systemctl edit some.service").  Contrary to the
;; command-line "systemctl" tool, systemctl.el allows viewing and
;; editing of remote unit files thanks to TRAMP.
;;
;; Key bindings `s t a r t' and `s t o p' can be used to start and stop
;; services.  Similarily, `e n a b l e' and `d i s a b l e' can be used to
;; permanently enable and disable unit files.

;;; Todo:

;; * Have someone with window/frame-fu see if there is a better way to
;;   visit N files in a frame, each in a separate window.  The current approach
;;   feels a bit crude, see `systemctl-edit-unit-files'.
;; * Optionally automatically reload the Systemd daemon when a unit buffer is
;;   saved.
;; * Detect if we are not root, and use the sudo method to edit
;;   system files on localhost.
;; * Add support for local and remote systemd user sessions.
;; * Figure out what's necessary to support local and remote containers.
;; * Menu entries for `systemctl-list-units-mode'.
